# Journee

## A collaborative trip planner

Coordinating a trip with multiple people is such a struggle. Journee can help! Each member of your group can add places they're interested in visiting directly from the map. Then you can drag them to a shared calendar to plan out your itinerary, whether the trip be only a few hours long, or a few years long. In addition, we'll sort these places of interest based on distance from each other to make it easier for planning.
